If you need help  just make an issue about it.
This is a server software package i contributed to.
if you dont want/hate eaglers - remove all of the eagler plugins
If you want me to add another plugin, have it be open source
If you need help setting it up make an issue or follow the steps.

1. you need a host of some kind - any webhosting will work
2. chmod +x run.sh / run.bat (run.bat starts the server on windows)
3. ./run.sh (starts on linux)

if you intend on using this - this is the whole server setup.
nothing else is needed - if plugin installation is supported on yuor host make sure you add the  plugins in the plugins folder.
i didnt pre-make configs for GrimAC and NCP - so if you intend to use this on eaglers make it a bit looser. That will make sure they dont false flag too much.
